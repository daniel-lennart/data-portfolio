Now mostly known as an affluent commuter town, Bothwell offers an attractive blend of ancient history and modern prosperity.The picturesque ruin of Bothwell Castle – a fine example of Gothic architecture – overlooks the river on the outskirts of the town. Nearby is the original choir structure of the Church of St Bride, built in 1398 by the wonderfully named Archibald the Grim on the foundations of an old Norman church.The name of our development also reflects an important piece of Bothwell’s history: 16th Century nobleman James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, was the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.A new development of award-winning homesInto a secluded and peaceful area of Bothwell, we are introducing Hepburn Gate: A stylish development of 43 four- and five-bedroom detached homes from our award-winning Boutique collection.Only nine miles south-east of Glasgow city centre, the development is easily accessible by road and rail: It is an ideal location for commuting to both Glasgow and Edinburgh. Bothwell itself supports a charming assortment of shops, cafés, pubs and restaurants.High standards of education is one of the many reasons behind this area’s popularity. Hepburn Gate is served by two primary schools, Bothwell and St Bride’s, both of which have an excellent reputation. Our development is also within the catchment area of two highly respected secondary schools; Uddingston Grammar and Holy Cross High School.For leisurely hours, Bothwell is home to golf and bowling clubs, while Wooddean Park offers football fields as well as plenty of green space for play and exercise. A footbridge over the River Clyde links directly to the popular David Livingstone Centre; a great destination for a family day out.

Now mostly known as an affluent commuter town, Bothwell offers an attractive blend of ancient history and modern prosperity.The picturesque ruin of Bothwell Castle – a fine example of Gothic architecture – overlooks the river on the outskirts of the town. Nearby is the original choir structure of the Church of St Bride, built in 1398 by the wonderfully named Archibald the Grim on the foundations of an old Norman church.The name of our development also reflects an important piece of Bothwell’s history: 16th Century nobleman James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, was the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.A new development of award-winning homesInto a secluded and peaceful area of Bothwell, we are introducing Hepburn Gate: A stylish development of 43 four- and five-bedroom detached homes from our award-winning Boutique collection.Only nine miles south-east of Glasgow city centre, the development is easily accessible by road and rail: It is an ideal location for commuting to both Glasgow and Edinburgh. Bothwell itself supports a charming assortment of shops, cafés, pubs and restaurants.High standards of education is one of the many reasons behind this area’s popularity. Hepburn Gate is served by two primary schools, Bothwell and St Bride’s, both of which have an excellent reputation. Our development is also within the catchment area of two highly respected secondary schools; Uddingston Grammar and Holy Cross High School.For leisurely hours, Bothwell is home to golf and bowling clubs, while Wooddean Park offers football fields as well as plenty of green space for play and exercise. A footbridge over the River Clyde links directly to the popular David Livingstone Centre; a great destination for a family day out. For strolls through woodland and along the riverside, the Clyde Walkway runs through Uddingston, Bothwell and Blantyre all the way to Strathclyde Country Park.Generous specifications and trusted brandsBuilt with minute attention to detail and the experience gained through the Robertson Group’s nearly 50 years of house-building, these homes have bright, spacious rooms in layouts that are practical and modern.Opening HoursThur - Mon, 10.30 - 17.30",http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/44503121?utm_source=v1:oOyPDCfGCwDb5R2neLop4zP7P0Mr1OCF&utm_medium=api,"Plot 4, Hepburn Gate At Goldie, Bothwell Park Industrial Estate, Uddingston, Glasgow G71",2017-04-26 01:45:44,"['https://lc.zoocdn.com/2284a9d53b28fd516cdabc403c72820cb6f31b62.jpg', 'https://lc.zoocdn.com/09f70bbb268c2572440001ca4c7c3765b45bd5d7.jpg']",https://li.zoocdn.com/0d9c79af7ebe9da3f1209706588130c89b7b4b4f_150_113.jpg,https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/0d9c79af7ebe9da3f1209706588130c89b7b4b4f.jpg,https://li.zoocdn.com/0d9c79af7ebe9da3f1209706588130c89b7b4b4f_50_38.jpg,https://li.zoocdn.com/0d9c79af7ebe9da3f1209706588130c89b7b4b4f_645_430.jpg,https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/0d9c79af7ebe9da3f1209706588130c89b7b4b4f.jpg,Ivory Garden Room Hepburn Gate,https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/0d9c79af7ebe9da3f1209706588130c89b7b4b4f.jpg,2017-07-21 01:49:29,55.810135,,44503121,sale,-4.067021,True,3,4,3,2,G71,Glasgow,387500,"[{'price': '387500', 'percent': '0%', 'direction': '', 'date': '2017-04-26 01:00:03'}]",,,,,Detached house,"This is a spacious five-bedroom detached home with an internal garage.

The superb gardens surrounding the house were reputed at one time to contain every type of tree native to Britain, as well as many other exotic species. The house subsequently became the centre of Ashludie Hospital. Monifieth is beautifully located between open farmland to the north and an attractive, sandy beach on the Firth of Tay, popular with holidaymakers, to the south. The development is around ten minutes walk from the local shops in Monifieth High Street, including a post office, a newsagent and convenience store, an off-licence, traditional baker’s and butcher’s shops and a choice of cafés and takeaways, as well  as a large Tesco store. There is also a garden centre at Ethiebeaton Park, and a wider range of shops in Broughty Ferry and Dundee. Monifieth also has a Recycling Centre.Ashludie is less than quarter of a mile from Seaview Primary, the first school in Angus to achieve Gold in all aspects of the Council’s Reading School programme. For secondary education, pupils normally move on to the highly-regarded Monifieth High School. Monifieth Medical Practice and an adjacent pharmacy are located on the edge of the Ashludie development, and there are two dental surgeries in Monifieth High Street. Train services run from Monifieth into Dundee and Edinburgh in the mornings and return in the evenings. The development is half a mile from the A92 and six miles from the centre of Dundee, and buses into Dundee city centre, Dundee Technology Park and Ninewells Hospital pass the development.

509,"127 Queensberry Street, Dumfries",https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(65306).jpeg,Realter,01387 201996,Residential,Scotland,gb,Dumfries & Galloway,"Realter Estate Agents are delighted to present to the market the baronial manor home, Rockhall, in Dumfriesshire. This magnificent and historically significant property provides the owner with 4 reception rooms, 7 bedrooms (each with its own facilities), and extensive outbuildings set out across its 10.65 acres of land. The land can easily create 2 paddocks for equestrian usage or the house maybe used as a boutique B and B or just a great family home with stunning views across DumfriesGrade b-listed, the oldest parts of the house date back to the late 1400's. Rockhall was extended in the early 1700's to give its current 'L' layout, and subsequently re-modelled c.1880, and again c.1915. Rockhall retains many features from throughout the centuries, and cascades period charm at every turn. Recent work has seen the property re-wired and re-plastered, and the exterior painted, ensuring this 600 year old building remains in excellent condition for years to come.With property of this standard on offer, viewing of Rockhall comes very highly recommended indeed.InteriorEntering Rockhall's front door, we arrive in a bright vestibule which leads to the property's hall, currently used as a sitting room. Here, a wood burning stove is perfectly placed to deliver heat to all three floors, complimenting the extensive oil fired central heating system. Tall deadlight windows bellow light into both this space and the two gallery landings overhead throughout the day, whilst a truly captivating chandelier takes on the role at night. From the hall, we enter a grand dining room with open fireplace, ornate cornicing, and views across Dumfries to Criffel, some 10 miles away. Also from the hall, we access the utility/boiler room, and a downstairs cloakroom. Turning left upon entering, we approach the oldest part of the building, with its vaulted ceilings and other-worldly corridor from days long since passed. It is here where we find the cellar, with original loophole windows, and of course, the magnificent kitchen which has been meticulously adapted for modern living. Two large Corian topped islands - with twin sinks, five ring induction hob, and two ring gas stove - provide excellent amounts of workspace, whilst a matching breakfast bar makes it a glorious space in which to enjoy the morning. Three ovens are housed within the modern fitted units, and a period fireplace adds further character yet. An external door leads to a large terrace, which catches the light from late afternoon and onwards into the night, making it a fabulous place upon which to entertain, with its feature lighting built in to the ground.The first floor gallery landing leads to the beautiful drawing room - with open fireplace and french windows to a first floor balcony/fire escape; the master suite - with large four piece en-suite bathroom and separate dressing room; a study; a second cloakroom, and a small kitchenette. On the second floor, we find a further six bedrooms. Each is served by its own modern en-suite facilities.OutsideWe arrive at Rockhall through b-listed sandstone gate piers at the foot of the driveway, which leads to a generous turning circle at the front of the property, and further parking space at the rear.There are a range of outbuildings at Rockhall, including a garage and wood store at the rear of the property, a fully serviced log cabin, a large modern workshop and storage shed, and large greenhouse.Amongst the 10.65 acres at Rockhall are sweeping lawns, mature woodland, walnut groves, kitchen gardens (with poly-tunnel and raised beds), a winding burn, pond, and well established walkways. Numerous hidden gems throughout the grounds include a centuries old stone seating area, and a grade b-listed monument, said to mark the grave of a once well-loved horse.**The vendor has indicated that if the purchaser should prefer not to inherit all of the 10.65 acres, the amount of land sold with Rockhall can be negotiated.Historical NoteThe lands of 'Rocail' in Dumfriesshire were at first attained by Gilbert Grierson of Lag upon his marital union to Isobel, daughter of and heiress to Sir Duncan Kirkpatrick of Torthorwald in 1412. Construction of the house began c.1500, and Rockhall has been the seat of the Grierson Clan ever since its completion in the early 16th century.Sir Robert Grierson of Lag (1655/6 - 1733) was, as Steward of Kirkcudbright, one of the most vehement persecutors of the Covenanter movement throughout south west Scotland. It is said that the cellar at Rockhall served as a prison for those who refused to fall in line with the Episcopalian rule imposed by a succession of Stuart kings. His notoriety gave Sir Walter Scott cause to write the famous 'Redgauntlet'. A Tale of the Eighteenth Century', based on tales of Grierson's callousness, and subsequent adaptations for screen have been filmed here.In 1526, King James V of Scotland passed a charter which elevated the lands of the Grierson family to the status of feudal barony. The territories have diminished somewhat since those medieval times, but Rockhall has always remained. A 2004 Act of the Scottish Parliament separated baronial titles from the lands they had previously been tethered to, however the current owners have made the Barony of Lag title available to the purchaser of Rockhall, subject to separate negotiations. The title will not be made available to anyone other than the purchaser of Rockhall.For more information, please visit .SituationRockhall sits proudly atop the Collin hills, overlooking the historical market town of Dumfries in south west Scotland. The owner of Rockhall can enjoy uninhibited views across the area, to the magnificent backdrop of Criffel, one of the region's highest peaks, rising some 569 metres from the Solway Coast.Despite the rural setting of Rockhall, Dumfries is only 5 miles from the property, and provides plentiful amenities to its residents. The town has twice in the past 25 years been voted the best place to live in Britain, and is a gateway to the vast expanse of breathtaking countryside throughout Dumfries and Galloway, wherein the purchaser can enjoy a plethora of outdoor pursuits. The region is home to several first rate golf courses (including the challenging links course at Southerness - arguably the finest course south of Carnoustie), a multitude of sailing and fishing spots (both inland and at sea), various shoots, world class mountain biking, and mile after mile of equestrian trail.The neighbouring villages of Collin and Mouswald both have excellent primary schools, and there are a number of secondary schools within Dumfries, including Dumfries Academy, where a certain J.M. Barrie studied prior to writing what is perhaps the most celebrated children's story of all time.Access to the M74, linking Scotland and England, is a short 12 mile journey away from Rockhall, with Glasgow and Edinburgh 79 and 81 miles away respectively. Both Dumfries and nearby Lockerbie have railway stations, providing excellent links to London, which can be reached in around 4 hours.Additional Home report informationIn reference to damp at high level on gable end (fire excape end) the chimney was was rebuilt with an extra lead course inserted. Also lathe and plaster removed and replaced in the two bedrooms below.With reference to the report of defective roof joists at other end of house these where removed and replaced with the usual written guarantee.With reference to the report of rising damp in corridor next to kitchen and damp at bottom of stairs a damp course was inserted with the usual written guaranteeThe lathe and plaster from floor to ceiling was completely removed and replaced by a drywall system on woodburning stove wall.With reference to the report of damp in the ingoes of the kitchen a damp course was inserted with the usual written guarantee.The house, downpipes and gutters were repainted and any repairs as necessary carried out.DirectionsFrom Dumfries, head easterly on the A75. The road expands to dual carriageway, and after two miles or so, becomes single lane again. At this point, look for the third road on the left, signposted Torthorwald. Follow for 300 yards or so, and the Driveway to Rockhall is directly ahead at the crossroads.",http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/34071088?utm_source=v1:oOyPDCfGCwDb5R2neLop4zP7P0Mr1OCF&utm_medium=api,"Rockhall, Collin, Dumfries, Dumfries And Galloway.

Newly renovated and trading as a 10 bedroom bed and breakfast, this attractive business has forward bookings usually seen in a more established guest house such is the appeal of the property on the booking websites utilised. Located only 2 miles from Inverness city centre, Drumdevan gives the impression of being a rural property in a quiet country side location.The house was built in the 1840s and has an interesting history, inhabited mostly as a family home, the property was fully renovated by the present owner who had lived there for some 16 years until the family had all left. The property was completely stripped out inside and refigured as the bed and breakfast it is today. Attention to detail is evident, not only in the guest rooms and owners area, but also in the systems installed; the fire system, electrics, heating, and sound proofing are all installed with both guest comfort and house efficiency in mind and the house is economical to run.With the renovation complete the current owner commenced trading with the services of a manager and housekeeper, and this is how the business currently operates. Utilising the various portal websites available such as and expedia etc, the bookings for the property have far exceeded expectations. Following a move overseas the owner has decided to place this exciting business opportunity on the market and concentrate on other ventures. The sale of Drumdevan Private Hotel represents an exceptional opportunity for new operators to own a prestigious property and operate what will be a most impressive business.TradeDrumdevan trades as a bed and breakfast offering a continental breakfast which is delivered to guests on trays. The ground, first and second floors are all set to bedrooms and each room contains a dining table and chairs for guests to enjoy their breakfast.

Occupancy levels based on forward bookings are high and the business is on track to develop as a very successful and profitable bed and breakfast.LocationThe centre of Inverness is 2 miles from Drumdevan Private Hotel and the business is ideally situated for those wishing to enjoy both a busy city visit and a relaxing stay. Inverness has extensive facilities for visitors boasting two golf courses, an excellent indoor swimming complex, cinema, bowling and ample opportunity to enjoy evening entertainment at a range of venues which include Eden Court Theatre. Nearby Cawdor Castle offers a taste of Scotland’s medieval past while Culloden Battlefield and Visitor Centre is an ongoing testament to Bonnie Prince Charlie’s final futile attempt to gain the throne in 1746. Whether it is a whisky trail, a boat trip on Loch Ness or a visit to one of the many accessible Scottish castles, the property is ideally situated to allow guests to undertake their odyssey of the Highlands, being within easy reach of a wide range of visitor attractions.

EPC Rating EHistoryThe name Arthurstone House is reputed to have come from a stone dedicated by the legendary King Arthur to his wife Guinevere. The earliest parts of the present house date from around 1789 when Captain James Ramsey rebuilt it upon older remains. In 1838, the owner Patrick Murray of Simprim commissioned William Burn to add the Victorian wing facing south-east and north-west, although much of this was subsequently dismantled by his son-in-law Admiral Brunswick Popham. By 1869 the house was owned by Peter Carmichael, head of the renowned spinners and manufacturers (Baxter Brothers of Dundee). He added the library and billiard room and the property remained in his family until 1990. The house was then used as a preparatory school until its closure in 2003. The present development comprises 15 properties and retains the character and charm from the Carmichael house.DirectionsFrom Perth, take the A94 to Coupar Angus and continue in the direction of Forfar for three miles.

EPC Rating E</p><h3 class=""listing-desc-header top""><strong>History</strong></h3><p class=""top"">The name Arthurstone House is reputed to have come from a stone dedicated by the legendary King Arthur to his wife Guinevere. The earliest parts of the present house date from around 1789 when Captain James Ramsey rebuilt it upon older remains. In 1838, the owner Patrick Murray of Simprim commissioned William Burn to add the Victorian wing facing south-east and north-west, although much of this was subsequently dismantled by his son-in-law Admiral Brunswick Popham. By 1869 the house was owned by Peter Carmichael, head of the renowned spinners and manufacturers (Baxter Brothers of Dundee). He added the library and billiard room and the property remained in his family until 1990. The house was then used as a preparatory school until its closure in 2003. The present development comprises 15 properties and retains the character and charm from the Carmichael house.</p><h3 class=""listing-desc-header top""><strong>Directions</strong></h3><p class=""top"">From Perth, take the A94 to Coupar Angus and continue in the direction of Forfar for three miles.

Bryant worked closely with Glasgow-based architects, Cooper Cromar, to design a range of luxury apartments, within two landmark towers, to reflect the ‘less rooms, more space message’. Inside, the extensive use of floor-to-ceiling glazing and the private balcony (off the master bedroom) cleverly acts as an extension to the internal space and makes the most of the natural light. The apartment has a very bright and airy feel with spectacular views towards the West End.This is the perfect apartment for entertaining, the open-plan kitchen extends into the living space, ensuring that the chef is never far away from the party. The kitchen is a feast of modern, minimalistic chic, with streamlined work surfaces over flush unit doors in natural tones, a built-in oven, hob, extractor hood, dishwasher and fridge freezer, meaning it is equipped for convenience and functionality. The extensive glazing in this zone makes the most of the natural light to create a modern and contemporary ambience. Stunning views of the West End are available from the full height windows in this zone and there is ample space for a table and chairs for more formal dining with friends and family.Clear, crisp and contemporary styling continues into the two bedrooms, with bespoke ‘his’ and ‘hers’ fitted wardrobes in the master bedroom, along with a private balcony, offering stunning views of the central courtyard and the surrounding area into the distance. The cleverly designed en-suite features a large walk-in shower. The second bedroom also benefits from fitted wardrobes. The sleek main bathroom exudes luxury, with an elegant white suite, which demonstrates the stylish attention to detail.The apartment is serviced by gas central heating to radiators, double glazing, satellite tv and aerial sockets. Residents can also enjoy peace of mind with a door entry handset, an elevator to all floors and an integrated video link and a concierge service (7 Days a week - 7.30am - 6.30pm that includes C.C.T.V.Storage is a necessity in modern living and the apartment has generous integral storage in the principal bedroom as well as the hallway, which also contains plumbing and drainage for a washing machine, making the very best of available space.Lifestyle is highly regarded within the development, which features private underground parking (Space 177) and modern landscaped gardens.

2202,"68 Bridge Street, Dollar",https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(269815).png,Henderson Roche,01259 257976,Residential,Scotland,gb,Perth & Kinross,"Briglands is approached from the north by a tarmac and gravel driveway that sweeps up through a wooded section of the gardens to an impressive rusticated arched entrance and decorated wrought iron gate giving access to a cobbled courtyard. Over the oak entrance door is a carved stone depicting the coat of arms of the Clyde family.The reception hall has painted fielded panelling, a stone fireplace, built in bookshelves and a stair leading to the first floor. The dining room also features traditional panelling and a tripartite bow window added by Lorimer and an open marble fireplace with a Vermont wood burning stove. The kitchen opens into a large living / dining area with a half glazed door to the garden and the lawns to the south. The kitchen is fitted with oak cupboards, timber worktops and a venerable four door oil-fired Aga. There is also a Vermont stove and a further open fireplace in the living / dining part of the room and a discreet service stair up to the first floor drawing room. To the north side of the house two rear entrances are connected by a utility room. The eastmost entrance gives access to the first floor via the back stairs which also has a WC off. The westmost entrance links to the kitchen and also leads via the turret spiral stair to the first and second floors.The first floor can be accessed by any one of four staircases, the east most being the main stair. The magnificent formal drawing room has five south facing windows overlooking the gardens and is fitted with bookshelves, two fireplaces and a staircase leading to the second floor. There are three bedrooms on this floor, one with a tripartite bow window and a marble and tiled fireplace and another with delightful views over the gardens to the south and west. There are also two bathrooms and a small serving kitchen off the drawing room, this completes the accommodation of the main house on this floor.The second floor is in two sections. The eastern part is accessed by the main staircase and contains three bedrooms all with coved decorative plaster ceilings. The east most bedroom has decorative plasterwork of flowers, birds and foliage. A large cupboard and a semi circular bathroom occupy the remainder of this part of the second floor.Access to the western part is by the turret spiral stair or a stair from the first floor drawing room. These stairs lead directly into the vaulted long gallery featuring Lorimer's plasterwork at its neo-Jacobean best. The various panels, enriched with floral and bird motifs, depict the Four Seasons and the Four Quarters of the World. The gallery in turn leads to the billiard room with its fantastic vaulted ceiling. Originally conceived as a billiard room, it was never used as such during the Clyde family's ownership as Lord Clyde did not play the game. It was therefore noted on Lorimer's plans as the Music Room with a Smoking Alcove off. It is now fitted with a billiard table by Taylors of Edinburgh.The west wingThe west wing has it's own separate entrance on the north side of Briglands. The entrance hall leads through to the main living room which has west facing French doors leading out into the gardens. There is a solid fuel stove. A door opens to kitchen which has had it's units and worktops removed ready for the new owners to refit as they wish. There are a further 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a study and a first floor reception room.Gardens and groundsBriglands is set in glorious established gardens and policy woodlands of about 7 acres. The tarmac drive, flanked by rhododendrons and magnificent mature broadleaf trees, sweeps up to a graveled carriage turn, revealing a view of the east end of the house. A substantial area of woodland lies to the north of the house, shielding it visually from the road and providing shelter from the elements.The majority of the gardens lie to the south of the house and are reached by four sets of steps leading from the house itself or from the courtyards. The main lawn, slightly sloping, is divided from the remainder of the garden by an axial path, parallel to the house and flanked on one side by mature lime trees. There are two timber summer houses and an open machinery shed for lawn mowers on the periphery of the lawns to the south and east.OutbuildingsTo the north of the house and close by is a range of traditional stone outbuildings. On the south side there are four store rooms and a tool shed that also contains the central heating oil tank. On the north side is a good sized workshop and garage - previously the laundry - and a further three garages and a workshop.HistoryOriginally a small Georgian country house, Briglands was dramatically extended and enhanced in the late 19th and early 20th Century by Sir Robert Lorimer.Lorimer was also a protagonist of the Arts and Crafts movement and by applying his own unique interpretation of the Scottish Vernacular to his designs he rapidly became the architect to those who aspired to gracious country living. His attention to detail and the use of both fine materials and the best craftsmen that Scotland could offer produced the buildings for which he is so well known.Briglands was commissioned by James Avon Clyde, the Edinburgh advocate and later judge, Lord Clyde, in 1897.In his book “Lorimer and the Edinburgh Craft Designers” (Harris, 1980), Peter Savage wrote: “He (Lorimer) took an old but spoilt building and gave it new life. The gleaming white walls, stone trim, and its garden all foreshadow the work for which he became particularly well known. The design had provided for a billiard room and other accommodation in a new wing to be extended on the west.”The original Georgian house, with date stones from 1743 and 1759 still in place today, was remodelled and extended to Lorimer's designs in two stages, firstly in 1897-8 and then in 1908. His free adaption of 17th century Scottish architecture enabled the use of the forms and details that came to typify his work. Steep roofs, crow step gables, carved animal heads, stone topped dormer windows, relief carving, a sundial, turrets with ogee roofs, fine ironwork, a well and a basin fountain are all to be found in this example of his early work. The house was first featured in Country Life magazine in September 1913 and has appeared in various publications since.The interior of the house is almost entirely Lorimer. By this time (1898) he had already established the team of craftsmen around him that would work with him for the next two decades. That team included Samuel Wilson (plasterwork), Thomas Hadden (blacksmith) and the Clow brothers (wood carving). Examples of their work can be seen throughout Briglands. The attention to detail produces a satisfying harmonious interior that is not so grand as to be impersonal. The rooms, whilst spacious and in some instances imposing, are comfortable for today's family living.Robert Lorimer also designed the layout for the gardens. Two formal courtyards, one being the entrance to the house, the other a sunken garden containing a well and a basin fountain, link the house to the main lawns. Around these lawns are positioned the many 'rooms' and the axial paths and walks that form the impressive, well maintained garden of today. These include rhododendron walks, a rose garden, many ornamental trees and shrubs, yew topiary and a host of spring bulbs. The garden has been opened occasionally under Scotland's Gardens and to groups and individuals for charitable purposes.The house is presently split into two dwellings - the main house and the west wing. It has been in the current ownership for some 38 years and is offered for sale in its entirety.LocationBriglands is set in beautifully presented gardens and grounds of about 7 acres in a secluded position, close to Dollar and within easy commuting distance of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Perth.Crook of Devon (referring to a bend in the River Devon) offers a range of local services including post office, pub, garage and Fossoway Primary School.
